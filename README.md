Parine’t Magkape: Stochastic Queue Simulation
 
Course: ITEC 203 – Quantitative Methods

Overview
  Parine’t Magkape is a web-based simulation tool that models the flow of a coffee shop using the M/M/c/K Queuing Theory. It simulates customer arrivals, barista service times, and seating constraints using stochastic variables.

Features
  Stochastic Engine: Uses Exponential Distribution for realistic arrival times.
  Barista Management: Models parallel processing with multiple servers.
  Spatial Analysis: Tracks seating vs. takeout conversion based on shop capacity.
  Real-Time Visualization: Dynamic "snaking" queue and barista progress bars.

How to Run
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
  3. Adjust the parameters in the sidebar and click "Start Simulation."
